%	abstract = {The way to improve the safety of vehicles using ADAS systems has successfully proved itself in practice. The use of ADAS systems in vehicles is mandatory in many countries of the world and is accepted at the state level. One of the most widely used ADAS systems is the Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS). The paper describes the principles of operation of existing LDWS in the segment of light commercial vehicles (LCV). The algorithm and structure of the developed LDWS for the GAZelle Next vehicle are presented. The description and analysis of algorithms for recognition of road markings are given. The results and comparative analysis of virtual and road tests of the LDWS are presented. Conclusions are given on the operation of the system and the algorithm for recognizing road markings.}
